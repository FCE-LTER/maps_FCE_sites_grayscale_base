Initial maps were created in R. Affinity Designer was used to add the following elements to map.

* Site labels
* Labels for the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic Ocean, Florida Bay, Biscayne bay, Tamiami Trail, US 1, Miami, Loop Current, and West Florida Shelf
* Modified legend
* Arrows showing freshwater and marine flow
* Photos of habitats \

Maps exported from R and Affinity Designer as png, EPS, and PDF files are in the exported_maps directory. \

Please contact Mike Rugge ([ruggem\@fiu.edu)](mailto:ruggem@fiu.edu) with questions about the maps. \
